mysql -> MariaDB client (CLI interface to communicate with the server)

    same as mariadb

    attempts to connect via unix socket to the daemon installed and running in the computer
    Lots of options, can pass a host and a port to attempt a remote connection, etcetcetc

##############################

mysqld -> daemon of the MariaDB server
    -> main program that accesses the directory that contains databases and tables (log files, etc)

    same as mariadbd

    we don't actually call the daemon, once installed it will be running from boot and listening
    we can do health checks to confirm the daemon is running

########################################

mysqld_safe -> daemon of the MariaDB server
    -> same as above, it is how the server is started. This executable is recommended
    for startup as it addresses some security concerns with the old executable

    same as mariadbd-safe


mariadb -u root (user root)
    -> login to the mariadb SERVER as root

    -> logins are done to the mariadb server. access to individual databases is done based on permissions
        permissions must be attributed to each
    so the server has an admin, and databases should have their own admins

    -e 
        execute statements from the command line without actually entering the mariadb shell


mnascime:

    	mariadb -u root -e "
        CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS $SQL_DB;
        CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS '$SQL_USER'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '$SQL_PASS';
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON $SQL_DB.* TO '$SQL_USER'@'%';
        ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$ROOTPASS';
        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
        SHUTDOWN;"

login as root (no password asked it is the first login)
execute the following statement right here and exit the shell immediately:

    create a database 
    create a user and a password
    all permissions on this database are given to this user
    change the root user, in this case to add a password
    force the recognition of previleges in this session
    safely stop the mariadb server


    Force recognition must be done because the server is still running when we exit the client
    However, since this execution includes creation of users, possibly the server
    will refresh anyways. Doesn't bother to leave it there in any case.




SHUTDOWN:

    MariaDB [nation]> shutdown
        -> ;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0,001 sec)

    MariaDB [nation]> select * from nation.countries
        -> ;
    ERROR 2006 (HY000): Server has gone away
    No connection. Trying to reconnect...
    ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local server through socket '/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)
    ERROR: Can't connect to the server

    we actually downed the daemon, so there is nothing for this client to connect to.
    must exit the client(useless, conection is down anyways, socket is closed)
