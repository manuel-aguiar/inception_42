    ARM Architecture: ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) is a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture, 
    which emphasizes a small set of simple instructions that execute quickly. ARM is designed to be energy-efficient 
    and is widely used in mobile devices, embedded systems, and increasingly in servers.

    x86-64 Architecture: x86-64 (also known as AMD64) is a CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architecture, 
    which includes a larger set of more complex instructions that can execute multiple operations in a 
    single instruction. This architecture is commonly used in desktops, laptops, and servers.
