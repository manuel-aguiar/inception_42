Server that serves as an interpreter of SQL queries sent to it. It is the Server
that is responsible for setting a listening socket for receiving connections.

MariaDB client essentially connects to the MariaDB server (mysql CLI is a client)

The MariaDB server ususally listens to both the Unix socket for local comunnication
and a tcp socket for external communication.

by default, MariaDb listens on 127.0.0.1:3306 and /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock or
/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
these changes can be configured in the mariadb.conf file

mariadb and client may agree to communicate using TLS. if a docker network is local
like inception, it is probably overkill since the only point of entry is nginx

however in case a docker network spans multiple hosts (machines), docker swarm mode,
machines may be on different machines and so the communication goes through the physical
boundary (literal cables wifi outside the machine), therefore such communication
should be encripted using for instance TLS.

furthermore, if an attacker gains access to a process on the host, it may be able
to intercept communications meaning unencrypted communication can be unsafe.

if in the future, the network is changed from local to remote, then it is already encrypted.



Now, php-fpm MUST IMPLEMENT the database communication tools itself. it make ssense since the scripts
themselves do not control if communication is encrypted or not.
So, when you configure php-fpm to communicate to the database using TLS, the runtime will
exeecute the sql queries using php-fpm configuration, which includes: protocols (TLS).

wp-config.php : in this file you pass data about ip, port and login details to actually
access the database. so php-fpm, when the call for a query is done, takes this info
and the configuration of encryption to actually open the socket and establishing communication.

So, php etablished the "when" and "what" of the communication to the database, whi php-fpm is responsible
for the "how".
